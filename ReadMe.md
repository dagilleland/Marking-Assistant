## Tech Stack

Built as an Electron App, it can be used on Windows and Mac desktops.

Also consider using Azure Functions if you want to supply a link to generate a repository from a starter kit (similar to the effect of GitHub Classroom). It should also be backed by some kind of root storage repository.
